# Engine database

The single reference table of engines, motors and thrusters for the PROPULSION
course. Every number here is consolidated from the two verification worksheets
`_verify-liquid.md` and `_verify-solid-coldgas.md`, with their caveats carried
across intact. Modules cite this file; this file cites the worksheets, and the
worksheets cite the sources.

## How to read this table

**Units.** SI throughout: kN for thrust, bar for pressure, seconds for specific
impulse, kg for mass. Where a source quoted US customary units (lbf, psia, in)
the converted value is given in parentheses on first appearance and inherits the
source's precision, not more. Conversions used: 1 kN = 224.809 lbf,
1 bar = 14.5038 psi, 1 MPa = 145.038 psi. $g_0 = 9.80665\ \mathrm{m/s^2}$.

**"n.p." means not published.** No primary or credible secondary source was
located by the verification pass. It is never a placeholder for a guess, and a
module must render it as "not reliably published" rather than filling it in.

**What "Pc" means.** Chamber pressure is not one quantity. Three different
stations circulate in the literature and secondary sources rarely say which they
are quoting:

| flag | station |
|---|---|
| `inj` | stagnation pressure at the injector face — the course's default convention (README) and standard US Apollo-era practice |
| `noz` | nozzle-stagnation pressure — standard Soviet/Russian practice and many modern datasheets; typically a few percent *lower* than injector-end |
| `dev` | a peak reached in development, not a flight-nominal rating |
| `n.s.` | station not stated by any source consulted |

A dagger (†) on `inj` or `noz` means the station is inferred from the worksheet's
national-convention rule (US Apollo era = injector-end, Soviet/Russian = nozzle
stagnation), not from a per-engine statement in a source. This is the single
largest recurring source of apparent disagreement in the liquid file. Comparing
the RD-180's 267 bar to the RS-25's 206 bar without stating the convention
overstates the gap slightly.

**Thrust tags.** Every thrust figure carries, or inherits from its table caption:

- `SL` / `vac` — sea level or vacuum. Never omitted for a real engine.
- `/motor` / `/vehicle` — one motor, or the whole vehicle's motors summed. This
  is a factor-of-two error when it goes wrong and it is the most common mistake
  in the secondary literature on solids. Part B tags every figure explicitly,
  including for single-motor vehicles where it looks redundant.
- `max` / `avg` — peak thrust or burn-averaged thrust. Solid motors with a
  strongly shaped trace (LVM3 S200: max/avg = 1.44) are meaningless without it.

**Confidence labels.** The solid/cold-gas worksheet uses an explicit A–D scale;
the liquid worksheet uses words. Both are reproduced, with this reading key:

| label | meaning | liquid worksheet's word |
|---|---|---|
| **A** | Primary source (NASA fact sheet, manufacturer data sheet, NTRS report, ESA page) read directly and quoted | "high" |
| **B** | Secondary source that itself cites a primary, internally consistent with other independent secondaries | "medium-high" |
| **C** | Single secondary source, uncorroborated, or a figure that failed an internal consistency check. Order of magnitude only | "medium" / "low-medium" |
| **D** | Could not verify. Recorded as a claim with the claimant named, or omitted | "low" |

The A–D column in Part A carries the liquid worksheet's word label with the
mapped letter in brackets; the mapping itself is editorial judgment [J], not a
worksheet statement. `CALC` marks a figure computed in the worksheet from stated
inputs rather than sourced.

**The "claim" rule.** Any figure marked **claim** is a company or agency claim
with no independent confirmation. SpaceX, Blue Origin, Rocket Lab, ArianeGroup
and Northrop Grumman publish almost nothing in the peer-reviewed or
government-report literature; most of their figures originate from websites,
press kits, conference talks or executive social-media posts, and several have
changed silently over time. Raptor, BE-3U, BE-4, Archimedes, Prometheus and BOLE
are presented as claims throughout. This is not a slight against those companies;
it is an accurate statement of the evidentiary situation, and it is the reason a
student should always ask where a number came from.

**Where sources disagree**, every value is given with its provenance in the
"notes and contested figures" list below each table. A table that silently picks
a winner teaches students that rocket performance figures are exact. They are
not.

**Records must be stated precisely.** The RD-170 produces more total thrust
(7,900 kN vac) than the F-1 (7,770 kN vac), but across four combustion chambers.
The F-1 remains the highest-thrust *single-chamber* engine ever flown. Both
records are real; say which one you mean, every time. Likewise keep flown and
unflown engines separate: the RD-0146's 470 s, the F-1A's 1,800,000 lbf and the
J-2S's 436 s are test-stand or paper figures and do not belong in the same column
as flight-demonstrated values.

**"Expander cycle" is three different cycles.** Closed expander (RL10, Vinci,
RD-0146, YF-75D), expander bleed (LE-5A/5B, LE-9, BE-3U) and tap-off (BE-3PM,
J-2S) are routinely all called "expander cycle" in the secondary literature. They
have materially different thrust ceilings and Isp penalties. Every engine in this
file is labelled with the specific variant.
